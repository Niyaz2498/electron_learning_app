—————————

Browser allows request to be made only from websites of same origin 
In other words 
Restricts how a script loaded from one origin interacts with the resource from other origin

Origin : 
	<scheme> “://” <hostname> [ “:” <port>]

If the scheme or port or host changes browser restricts interaction

Edge cases
——————————
Browser relaxes sop sometimes
1. Image tag (src) .browser relax this 

2. Cross - origin writes are allowed. e.g. post form submission.  
3. Cross-Origin embedding are allowed. 
4. Cross  origin reads are not allowed.

Iframes -> cross -origin embedding 

Preventing cross-origin writes 
Use synchroniser  token
(Safe since  cross-origin reads are not allowed )
Don’t use wildcard in cors header
